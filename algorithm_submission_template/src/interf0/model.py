"""
Interface 0 — Visual Grounding (template implementation).

This is where you plug in your VQA / vision-language model.

Steps:
  1. Load your model weights (MODEL_PATH is available from core.py).
  2. Replace the body of predict_visual_context_response with your inference logic.
  3. If your model lives in a separate repository, add it under src/ and import it here:

       from src.your_repo.your_module import YourVQAModel

Platform rules for this interface:
  - Return a clinically grounded free-text answer.
  - The output is a plain JSON string — just the answer text, nothing else.

    Returns:
        A plain string answer (written as a JSON string by inference.py).

    IMPORTANT — do not change the return type (must stay ``str``). The platform
    expects a plain JSON string in visual-context-response.json; changing this
    will break submission validation.
